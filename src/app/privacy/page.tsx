                IP address, MAC address, log files, domain server, data related
                to usage, performance, website security, traffic patterns,
                location information, browser and device information – only when

                balance information (blockchain data) that is accessible when
                interacting with the Interface; We use public Blockchain
                addresses to identify a user's journey through our product. We
                group and analyze these user journeys collectively in order to
                improve our product user experience. We do not use this data for
                any purpose at an individual user level. The legal basis for
                this processing is our legitimate interests, such as monitoring
                and improving the Interface, the proper protection of the
                Interface against risks, and partly the contract performance
                basis to provide you the Interface. Note that we are not

                Log Files. Solana App Kit follows a standard procedure of using log
                files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All
                hosting companies do this and this kind of Personal Data may
                also be collected as a part of hosting services' analytics. The
                data collected by log files include internet protocol (IP)
                addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date
                and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of
                clicks. These kinds of data may be linked to data that is
                personally identifiable. The purpose of the data collection and
                processing is for analyzing trends, administering the website,
                tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering
                demographic information;

              6. Your rights under GDPR
            </h2>
            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, you may have a number of privacy
              rights concerning the use, storage, and processing of your
              Personal Data (e.g., the right to delete your data). Here is a
              list of privacy rights:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                <b>right to be informed</b> - we are publishing this Privacy
                Policy to keep you informed as to what we do with your Personal
                Data. You can ask us for Personal Data regarding you that we
                keep at any time. This information concerns, among other things,
                the data categories we process, for what purposes we process
                them, the origin of the data if we did not acquire them directly
                from you and, if applicable, the recipients to who we have sent
                your data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right of access</b> – You may ask us whether we process your
                Personal Data and you have the right to request a copy of the
                data we hold about you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right of rectification</b> – You have the right to correct
                inaccurate or incomplete data about you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to be forgotten</b> – You can ask for the Personal Data
                that we hold about you to be erased from our system and we will
                comply with this request unless we have a legitimate reason,
                legal requirement, and other statutory basis not to do so. Even
                if we can delete (erase) the Personal Data subject to our active
                (ongoing) processing activities and cease its processing, we
                will nevertheless retain this particular Personal Data in our
                backup and archive storages to fulfill our statutory and other
                requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to restriction of processing</b> – where certain
                conditions apply, you can ask us to 'block' the processing of
                your Personal Data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to data portability</b> – You have the right to have
                the data we hold about you transferred to another organization
                and to receive Personal Data in a structured, commonly used
                format. Please apply to: aryan@sendai.fun to find out whether we
                currently support the provision of the portable file containing
                Personal Data we process about you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to object</b> - You can object to the processing of
                your data by applying to: aryan@sendai.fun at any time for
                reasons that arise from your special situation provided the data
                processing is based on our legitimate interest or that of a
                third party, or where we carry out profiling, use machine
                learning or automated decision-making algorithms. In this case,
                we will no longer process your Personal Data. The latter does
                not apply if we are able to prove there are compelling,
                defensible reasons for the processing that outweigh your
                interests or we require your data to assert, exercise, or defend
                legal claims.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to withdraw consent</b> - withdraw the consent you gave
                us with regard to the processing of your Personal Data for
                certain purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>right to complain</b> - we take your rights very seriously.
                However, if you are of the opinion that we have not dealt with
                your complaints adequately, you have the right to submit a
                complaint to the data privacy protection authorities
                responsible. You can send your complaints to the EEA supervisory
                authority of your country of residence.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Please email: aryan@sendai.fun with any questions about exercising
              any of the above rights. If You wish to learn more about the GDPR
              and Your rights, the Information Commissioner's Office website is
              a reliable source.

              7. Privacy of children
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our Interface is not directed to collect any data from people
              under the age of 18. We do not knowingly allow anyone under 18
              years old to submit any data to our Interface. If you believe your
              child may have provided us with their data, you can contact us
              using the information in this Policy and we will delete the data
              from our Interface.
            </p>

              8. Transfer of Personal Data
            </h2>
            <p>
              Transfers to third countries shall be made subject to appropriate
              safeguards, namely Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the
              supervisory authority and approved by the Commission. Copy of the
              foregoing appropriate safeguards may be obtained by you upon a
              prior written request sent. We may instruct you on further steps
              to be taken with the purpose of obtaining such a copy, including
              your obligation to assume confidentiality commitments in
              connection with being disclosed the Solana App Kit proprietary and
              personal information of third parties as well as terms of their
              relationships with Solana App Kit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that the use of the Interface based on public
              blockchains is intended to immutably record transactions across
              wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to
              forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the
              unintentional revelation of Personal Data, in particular when
              blockchain data is combined with other data. Because blockchains
              are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled
              or operated by us, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter
              Personal Data from such networks.

              9. Data Integrity & Security of Processing
            </h2>
            <p>
              We take data security very seriously. We work hard to protect the
              Personal Data you provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized
              access. We utilize a variety of safeguards such as encryption,
              digital and physical access controls, non-disclosure agreements,
              and other technical and organizational measures to protect the
              Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once
              it is at rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that no electronic transmission, storage, or
              processing of Personal Data can be entirely secure. We cannot
              guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard
              Personal Data will never be defeated or fail, or that those
              measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore,
              although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not
              promise, and you should not expect that your Personal Data will
              always remain private or secure.
