1. Create a new route /apps - that showcases all the apps built on top of Solana App Kit
There will be a semantic search bar for apps and one featured app for Home Screen like any marketplace, 2x2 grid for apps with 3 CTAs (Website  and Andriod and iOS links), 

2. Each App card will have:
1) Feature banner like playstore/appstore (which will be kinda preview for apps)
2) 90 character limit description
3) Tags (DeFi, DePIN, Memecoins, Trading, SocialFi, NFTs, Wallet)

3. Submit App and Get Featured” CTA in website —> 

Form will have:
1) App details (check solana mobile form)
2) and all fields to display
3) Their socials (Person who is submitting and project twitter)

check out marketplaces (like Airbnb) or app stores like (epic store etc) for inspiration
Think of it like an app launchpad.

use drizzle ORM and I'll add a supabase transaction pooler DB URL in the env.

overall, make it in the same current theme
